gp-jumps get very high at the moment. Maybe make levels be based on verticality, so this isn't a problem with the player just flying around

add first weapon: fists you have a 
	lmb: thats just a simple punch that is able to just be held down 
	rmb on ground: a single punch that has inside recoil for enemys, like flying across the map recoil
	rmb in air: a airdash to a enemy, either a one hit kill or insane damage (Bloodthief inspo)
